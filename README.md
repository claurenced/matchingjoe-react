# Matching Joe

# Introduction

I built this to further my learning with front-end web development using React and as a Christmas gift to my baby momma.

# Instructions

1. Start the game by clicking on a card to reveal the image.
2. Select a second image. If it is a match, the pair will remain flipped.
3. Continue the process until all cards are flipped.
4. Try to do it in as little turns as possible.

# Note to Jullie

Merry Christmas honey, you are the most loving and selfless partner and I am so happy that my son has a mother like you.
